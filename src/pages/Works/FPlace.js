                FPlace is a system that detects the movement in a room, and in
                each specific place through Processing. <br /> <br />
                What happens is that the program uses the camera and detects if
                there is a difference in pixels at each frame. If there is, it
                means that there is movement and the program considers the place
                occupied. However, this condition is not straightforward. What
                do I mean by this? That the place will only be occupied after x
                minutes of movement, and will only be vacant after x more
                minutes.
                <br />
                <br />
                This data is all passed to the web via JavaScript. <br />
                The Processing generates some txt documents and through
                JavaScript, I read these documents and perform actions on them.
                <br /> <br />
                In addition to the program providing the capacity of each room
                and the number of free seats (all variables that come directly
                from the processing), I chose to have a specific page of the
                room with a heatmap of the same. I thought it was important
                because many times we don't go to study alone, and in this way
                we can understand, inside the room, where the places are
                located.

              Being a platform for students, it was an important point for me
              ensure it was quick to learn. what do i mean by this? There are
              platforms that are so complex that it almost takes a manual to
              know how to handle them. I didn't want this at all happened so
              what I did was play with simplicity. I also tried to go get some
              references of applications of data and list visualization, in
              order to make the similar user experience.
